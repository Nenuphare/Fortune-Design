                <h2>What is Fortune Design?</h2>
                <p>Fortune Design is a creativity board game for children and adults.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="block" id="how-to-play">
                <p>The principle is simple: at the beginning of each round, a mission card will be drawn by the referee. These cards are creation missions. To do this, you have to acquire as many elements as possible for the creation of these missions.</p>
                <p>The players will then have to define their order of play with the dice.</p>
                <h3>Once the order is defined, the play can START!</h3>
            </article>
            <article class="block" id="gameplay">
                <p>The players will come to these squares:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typography &rarr; draw the card typography to know what is your typography</li>
                    <li>Color &rarr; draw the card color to know what is your color</li>
                    <li>Bonus/malus &rarr; draw the card fortune to know what is your bonus or malus</li>
                    <li>Jail &rarr; you go to the jail</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once the round is over, players must gather all the squares they have purchased during the game in order to complete the mission in 20 minutes. The game ends when a player announces the end of their creation.</p>
