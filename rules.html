                <h2>What is Fortune Design?</h2>
                <p>Fortune Design is a creativity board game. </p>
                <p>The principle is simple: players will have to create a design using the typography, colors, and shapes they receive during the game. </p>
                <p>Once the turn is over, the referee will draw a mission card so that players can create their design with the collected elements.</p>

                <h2>How To Play ?</h2>
                <p>Determine the order with the dice and the game can begin. Players will land on the following spaces:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typography &rarr; draw a typography card to discover your typography.</li>
                    <li>Colors &rarr; draw a color card to discover your color.</li>
                    <li>Bonus/Malus &rarr; draw a fortune card to discover your luck or misfortune.</li>
                    <li>Prison &rarr; go to jail for one turn.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You have 3 minutes to draw your creation. The first one to finish will receive 2 points, and the player with the most points will win the game. Fortune Design provides you with a scoring grid.</p>
